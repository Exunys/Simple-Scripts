Simple V3 Made by Exunys

Current Version : 3.4

~:~Information~:~

[1] This version of Simple (Simple V3) has encrypted scripts.
[2] It is most recommended that you run this script in a paid exploit because of the loading screen and the configuration saving system.
[3] This is the most protected version of Simple so far and reduces your chances of being detected by a lot.
[4] This script will save the keybinds and the settings from the settings tab that you have entered as long as you're using an exploit that supports that feature.
[5] This script has a very eye-friendly and a clean user interface with dark and eye-comforting colors and smooth tweening animations.

(!!!) If this script failed to run :
~ If you're using a paid exploit :
   - Go in your workspace folder in your exploit folder and delete the Simple Scripts folder.
~ If you're using a free exploit :
   - Press F9, take a screenshot and contact Exunys on discord at Aleksandar#4360.
   - Update your exploit.
   - Check your anti-virus software for any quarantined files that are crucial to your exploit and whitelist them.
~ Check if you're using the updated version of Simple V3. Find it at https://github.com/Exunys/Simple-Scripts

^^ Follow these instructions for if the script fails to run ^^
~ If the script crashes your game it is because an unsupported function has been executed from Simple that your script executor cannot handle / support.

These are trusted & recommended exploits that you should use to execute this script :

Synapse X, Sentinel, ProtoSmasher, SirHurt, Script-Ware, Calamari and krnl.
